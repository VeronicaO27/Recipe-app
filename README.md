# Soul Food Recipes: Bringing Flavor to Your Kitchen!

A full-stack application built using Java, Spring Boot, and React JS to search for recipes based on ingredients and categories, powered by the Edamam API and stored on AWS. Because who wants to eat bland food, right?

## Backend: The Secret Sauce
The backend of this delectable dish is made with Java and Spring Boot. And here's how we seasoned it:
1. I whipped up a new Spring Boot project using the Spring Initializer.
2. Defined the model class for recipes, the star of the show, with fields such as name, ingredients, category, and instructions.
3. I utilized the Edamam API to search for recipes and made sure they were stored safely on AWS.
4. I created a repository interface to interact with the database and retrieve recipe data like a pro.
And to top it off, I implemented a RESTful API to allow the frontend to access the recipe data and perform searches based on ingredients and categories like a boss.

## Frontend: Presentation is Everything

The frontend, the cherry on top of this culinary creation, is made with React JS. This is how I made it look so good:
1. I created a new React project using Create React App.
2. Defined the component for the search form, because searching for recipes should be easy and fun!
3. Implemented a call to the backend API to retrieve the matching recipes, because we want to make sure you get the best results.
4. Displayed the recipes for the user to drool over, because presentation is everything!
